# tetris
a simple tetris game
---
To run the game, simply enter the root folder and run ```pip3 install pygame``` & ```python3 src/main.py```

The game is meant to crash on startup, don't be scared!

### ez_version
---
The only file missing code in this version is BaseTetromino.py (though some of the values in config.py might need to be tweaked).\
We recommend you start with looking where the missing methods are being called from and figuring out what they're supposed to do.

Good luck! ðŸ˜‰
