# tetris
a simple tetris game
---
To run the game, simply enter the root folder and run ```pip3 install pygame``` & ```python3 src/main.py```

The game is meant to crash on startup, don't be scared!

### medium_version
---
In this version someone seems to have forgot to implement methods in both BaseTetromino.py and Game.py as well as messed up some of the values in config.py\
A great way to start is to get the game to output, the tetromino moving and error handling can be difficult without it.

Good luck! ðŸ˜ˆ!
