# tetris
a simple tetris game
---
To run the game, simply enter the root folder and run ```pip3 install pygame``` & ```python3 src/main.py```

The game is meant to crash on startup, don't be scared!

Oh noes!\
It looks like someone misplaced quite a lot of the code... Have fun fixing it ðŸ˜œ\
It's always good to start with making it not crash before trying to fix the internal logic.

Good luck! \
